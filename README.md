# wp-plugin-embed-cam
WordPress plugin to embed streaming video.

This plugin was designed for a WordPress site using the OleinPress theme.  Maybe it'll work for yours, too.

When activated, it creates an admin settings page in Settings > Embed Cam.  There are three settings:
  1. a checkbox which when checked will embed the cam at the bottom of the Home page & each Post page, right above the footer,
  2. a textbox where you can enter a heading that will appear above the embedded cam,
  3. a textbox to enter the <iframe> embed code.
